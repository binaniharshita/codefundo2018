     India being surrounded by water on three sides is highly prone to experiencing hurricanes and cyclones. These hurricanes cause immense loss of life and property, not only affecting people living in the that area but on the entire country as well. 
    Typically, hurricanes depend on a variety of factors such as temperature, humidity and pressure. Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes in to the low pressure area. Then that air becomes warm and moist and rises. As the warm air continues to rise, the surrounding air swirls in to take its place. As the warm, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean heat and water evaporating from the surface.
    Today, there are many technologies available to us. We can make use of such technologies such as weather APIs to closely monitor the above mentioned factors in a given area. This way we will be able to predict the direction and intensity of the hurricane. Destruction can also be determined by analyzing the population, agriculture and industry in that area. Hence, economic loss can be minimized. My aim would be to try to implement this idea so that losses due to hurricanes can be minimized.
